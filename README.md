# Company Dashboard

This is a small PHP project I built to practice OOP and learn how to organize a basic web app.

## What It Does

- Shows companies and their contacts
- Displays meetings with date and status
- Lets you filter by company
- Can export the data to CSV

## Files

│ ├─ Contact.php
│ └─ Meeting.php
├─ views/

└─ assets/
├─ style.css
└─ script.js

## How to Run

1. Copy the project folder to your XAMPP `htdocs`.  
2. Start Apache via XAMPP.

You will see a table with sample companies, contacts, and meetings.
